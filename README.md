Generates an HTML view of the Nightwatch.js test reports by either parsing the
XML files generated by Nightwatch or by using the Nightwatch reporter options.

## Compatibility

In version 0.6.4 Nightwatch changed the format of both the generated XML
reports and the object the reporter receives after a test run.

Version 0.3.1 is the last version that supports Nightwatch < 0.6.4


For **Nightwatch versions < 0.6.4**
```
npm install nightwatch-html-reporter@0.3.1
```

For **all other versions of Nightwatch**
```
npm install nightwatch-html-reporter
```

## Usage


### Using Built in Nightwatch reporter
_Requires Nightwatch >= 0.5.32._

```javascript
/* In nightwatch/globals.js */
var HtmlReporter = require('nightwatch-html-reporter');
var reporter = new HtmlReporter({
	openBrowser: true,
	reportsDirectory: __dirname + '/reports'
});
module.exports = {
	reporter: reporter.fn
};
```

### Using Command Line
_Assumes you have installed globally_
```bash
$ nightwatch-html-reporter -d ~/myProject/tests/nightwatch/reports
```

### Using Nightwatch `--reporter` option

Create a file beside nightwatch/globals.js that is called something similar to `html-reporter.js` with the contents
```javascript
var HtmlReporter = require('nightwatch-html-reporter');
/* Same options as when using the built in nightwatch reporter option */
var reporter = new HtmlReporter({
  openBrowser: true,
  reportsDirectory: __dirname + '/reports/'
});

module.exports = {
  write : function(results, options, done) {
    reporter.fn(results, done);
  }
};
```

then use the `--reporter` option like `./nightwatch --reporter ./html-reporter.js`

## Options

```javascript
{
        /* String. Relative path to custom theme. When this is given, `themeName` will be ignored. */
	customTheme: 'relative/path/to/theme.pug',

	/* Boolean. If true, then only errors will be shown in the report. */
	hideSuccess: false,
	
	/* Boolean. If true, the generated html will be opened in your browser after the test run. */
	openBrowser: true,

        /* Boolean. If true, we convert screenshot paths from absolute paths 
		to relative to output file. */
	relativeScreenshots: false
	
	/* String. The directory you've set nightwatch to store your reports.
		On the CLI this determines where we read reports from, but on this
		interface it determines where the generated report will be saved. */
	reportsDirectory: __dirname + '/reports',

	/* String. The filename that the html report will be saved as. */
	reportFilename: 'generatedReport.html',
	
	/* Boolean. If true, we append the last suite name to the report filename. */
	separateReportPerSuite: false,	
	
	/* String. The theme that will be used to generate the html report.
		This should match a directory under the lib/themes directory. */
	themeName: 'default',
	
	/* Boolean. If true, we ensure the generated report filename
		is unique by appending a timestamp to the end. */
	uniqueFilename: false,
}
```

## CLI usage

```bash
nightwatch-html-reporter -d <reports-directory> [--theme (default:'default')] [--output (default:generatedReport.html)]
```

```

-d, --report-dir            Directory where nightwatch reports are stored. [required]

## Available Themes

You can see examples of all of the available themes below.  You can also create your own theme by copying an existing
theme directory and editing the styles.css file.  If you want to also change the structure of the html generated
you can edit/copy `lib/themes/default/report.pug` which contains the markup for the majority of themes.

Theme options that are available on command line and in the options block:
* default
* default-gray
* compact
* compact-gray
* cover
* outlook
